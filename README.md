As a user who upkeeps a pool I wish to monitor and understand the various chemical aspects of my pool.

<h4>ASSUMPTIONS</h4>
Numbers are input in a float point format

<h4>EXAMPLES</h4>

When I input a pH level of 6.5 & a pool size of 16000 gallons

Then I should recieve proper guidance and chemical recommendations to return it to a safe pH range: "Your pH level is too low, add 4.5oz of dry acid to your pool. Do not swim for 8 hours after application."

<h4>ASSUMPTIONS</h4>

<h4>EXAMPLES</h4>

When I input a CYA value of -500

Then I should recieve a message asking for a vaild input range: "That is not a valid input, please input a positive number in the range (range for chemical)."
